This code implements a simple casino game in C++ where players can bet on guessing a number between 1 and 10. It prompts the player to enter their name and initial deposit amount before starting the game. The player is then asked to place a bet and guess a number. If the guessed number matches the randomly generated number, the player wins and receives ten times the betting amount; otherwise, the player loses the betting amount. The game continues until the player decides to stop playing or runs out of funds. Overall, it provides a basic interactive gambling experience with simple rules and gameplay.
